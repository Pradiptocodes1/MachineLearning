Abalone Age Estimation
-----------------------
abalone Problem Statement -
The age of an abalone can be found by cutting its shell and counting the number of rings on the shell. 
In the Abalone Dataset, you can find the age measurements of a large number of abalones along with a lot of other physical measurements.

The goal of the project is to develop a model that can predict the age of an abalone based purely on the other physical measurements. T
his would allow researchers to estimate the abaloneâ€™s age without having to cut its shell and count the rings.

ML Algorithm implemented - kNN
Fine Tuning of HyperParameters done using GridSearchCV 

Data taken from uci repository.

Predicting CO2 emissions 
-------------------------
Here we have taken the data for a list of cars of the Government of Canada that produce some amount of emissions. From this data we can 
predict the CO2 emissions of the vehicle. Basically used both Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regresssion for the data 
to analyse the change in various evaluation parameters like Mean Absolute Deviation, Root Mean Squared Error and found a considerable 
decrease in these values on switching from Simple to Multiple Linear Regression as expected. Changes of the ealuation metrics when parameters
were changed in Linear Regression was much more observable than that of Multiple Linear Regression.

ML algorithms implemented - Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression

Data taken from Canadian government archives.
