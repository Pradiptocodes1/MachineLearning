Abalone Age Estimation
-----------------------
abalone Problem Statement -
The age of an abalone can be found by cutting its shell and counting the number of rings on the shell. 
In the Abalone Dataset, you can find the age measurements of a large number of abalones along with a lot of other physical measurements.

The goal of the project is to develop a model that can predict the age of an abalone based purely on the other physical measurements. T
his would allow researchers to estimate the abaloneâ€™s age without having to cut its shell and count the rings.

Predicting CO2 emissions 
-------------------------
Here we have taken the data for a list of cars of the Government of Canada that produce some amount of emissions. From this data we can 
predict the CO2 emissions of the vehicle. Basically used both Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regresssion for the data 
to analyse the change in various evaluation parameters like Mean Absolute Deviation, Root Mean Squared Error and found a considerable 
decrease in these values on switching from Simple to Multiple Linear Regression as expected. Changes of the ealuation metrics when parameters
were changed in Linear Regression was much more observable than that of Multiple Linear Regression.

ML algorithms implemented - Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression

Data taken from Canadian government archives.

Predicting the Chinese GDP 
-------------------------
We have the data for the chinese gdp over the years starting from 1960 to 2015. Looking at the data curve, lower, highly steep in the middle and then a bit decrease
we observe that it shows a trend that can be easily fitted with a non-linear regression curve. The best beta1 and beta2 for the sigmoid function (beta 1 for the 
curve steepness and beta 2 to slide the curve on the axis) are found using the curve_fit function using the scipy.optimize library. We get a very good fit with 
almost best possible evaluation metrics(r2_score, MSE,MAD).

Service Provider
-------------------------
A Telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups. If demographic data can be used to predict group membership, the company can customize offers for individual prospective customers. It is a classification problem. That is, given the dataset, with predefined labels, we need to build a model to be used to predict class of a new or unknown case.
This uses various data parameters like demographic data,region, age etc. to predict usage patterns. Also analyzed different k values for the data

The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service We will build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases.

Medicine Analysis
-------------------------
Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.
Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The features of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and the Cholesterol of the patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to. 
Here, we notice that some of the independent parameters like BP have the parameters in textual format. So we convert them into numerical categories by importing the LabelEncoder from sklearn preprocessing. also, from sklearn.trees we import DecisionTreesClassifier to approach this statement via decision trees. Entropy waws used as the criteria for this classification.

Cancer type Prediction
-------------------------
From this dataset we will be predicting the category of the cancer from a group of patients. It can be either category 2(benign) or category 4(malignant). For this we will first plot a small set of data on a graph and then will be using Support Vector Machines to segregate bbetween two distinct category of data. The kernel function we used here will be the rbf which maps data into higher dimension. Similar results can be achieved in terms of accuracy score and jaccard score in case of linear or sigmoidkernel function, with the sigmoid function giving a lot less jaccard score. We used a function which properly visualises the confusion matrix with the spectral colour gradient. 

ML algorithm implemented - SVM
