Abalone Problem Statement -
The age of an abalone can be found by cutting its shell and counting the number of rings on the shell. In the Abalone Dataset, you can find the age measurements of a large number of abalones along with a lot of other physical measurements.

The goal of the project is to develop a model that can predict the age of an abalone based purely on the other physical measurements. This would allow researchers to estimate the abaloneâ€™s age without having to cut its shell and count the rings.
